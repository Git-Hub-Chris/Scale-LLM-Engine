# ⚡ LLM Engine ⚡

**The open source engine for fine-tuning large language models**. LLM Engine is the easiest way to customize and serve LLMs.
Use Scale's hosted version or run it in your own cloud.

## 💻 Quick Install

=== "Install using pip"
    ```commandline
    pip install scale-llm-engine
    ```

## 🤔 About

Foundation models are emerging as the building blocks of AI. However, 
fine-tuning these models and deploying them to the cloud are expensive 
operations that require infrastructure and ML expertise.

LLM Engine is a Python library, CLI, and Helm chart that provides
everything you need to fine-tune and serve foundation models in the cloud
using Kubernetes. Key features include:

🎁 **Ready-to-use APIs for your favorite models**:
Fine-tune and serve open-source foundation models, including MPT, Falcon,
and LLaMA. Use Scale-hosted endpoints or deploy to your own infrastructure.

🐳 **Deploying from any docker image**: Turn any Docker image into an
auto-scaling deployment with simple APIs.

🎙️**Optimized Inference**: LLM Engine provides inference APIs
for streaming responses and dynamically batching inputs for higher throughput
and lower latency.

🤗 **Open-Source Integrations**: Deploy any [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
model with a single command.

### 🔥 Features Coming Soon

❄ **Fast Cold-Start Times**: To prevent GPUs from idling, LLM Engine
automatically scales your model to zero when it's not in use and scales up
within seconds, even for large foundation models.

💸 **Cost Optimization**: Deploy AI models cheaper than commercial ones,
including cold-start and warm-down times.
