# Setup

We introduce alembic by
1. dumping the current db schemas into 'initial.sql' via pg_dump

```
pg_dump -h $HOST  -U postgres -O -s -d $DB_NAME -n hosted_model_inference -n model -f initial.sql 
```

2. writing an initial revision that reads and applies intial.sql script

```
alembic revision -m “initial”
```

3. Stamping the current revision to our production db to avoid actually running it on production

```
alembic stamp fa3267c80731
```
